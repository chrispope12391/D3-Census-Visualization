# D3-Challenge
Using HTML create a website that generates a scatter that compares 2014 census information against each other with multiple indexes on the X & Y axis. When you toggle a new index the graph changes is populated by the selected axis' data.

## Getting Stated 

1. Create a new repository and title it as you please. My repository is titled "D3-Challenge".

1. Clone the new repository to your computer.

1. This project utilizes both html and Javascript so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

1. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Summary

### D3 interactions

For this part we wanted to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables. Below each axis will be additional data variables. If the inactive data variable is selected it will updated the scatter plot and become the active variable. For this part we included:

* State abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Create click events for your additional labels to allow the user to select the data they wish to display

Once done the results should resemble this:

### Incorporating D3 toolTip

Include toolTip to allowing the x & y value for each axis variable. Once done the results should resemble this:
